### Getting Started

- Learnt concepts & terms like: What's a:
  - AWS WA **[Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html)**: Review Architecture -> To improve designs over time (using consistent approach, guidance)
  - WA **[Tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/userguide/intro.html)**: Review workloads against AWS current best practices with [features](https://aws.amazon.com/well-architected-tool/features/) like review, colab, discovery, support
  - **Workload**: (Resource + Code) collection making up a cloud app solving a biz problem
  - **Lens**: (Industry + Tech domain specific) Collection of Pillars, Questions, Answer Choices, Resources, Improvement Plans
    - Relevant Eg: Migration, ML, SaaS, Serverless, Container Build, Data Analysis
  - [Guide/ Soln/ Patterns](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/): Eg: Devops, Disaster recovery, Cloud governance management, Content localization, etc
