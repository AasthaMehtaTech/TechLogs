# 15 Nov: Today, I'm onto backing up & migrating data from older mac to a newer one. 
- Backed up icloud files by just turning sync on, 
- But wait what about offline un-synced notes? I learnt we can do the same by Copy Pasting No-SQLite files at their correct locations.
- Good thing was all the code was on git, so no worries but what if I don't wanna lose my local stashes & branch info?? Projects folder zip copy paste (deleting node_modules, lib folders) did the trick
- What if I did wanna transfer a single stash from one machine to another? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3973034/export-a-stash-to-another-computer
- Transferring Other AWS profile configs, .zshrc, .npmrc made it a seamless transition
- And Google Bookmarks, sync made it easier to handle data transfer in few clicks.
